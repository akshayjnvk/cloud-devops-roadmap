🗂️ How to Organize Your Learning (Important)

Create ONE GitHub repo:

cloud-devops-labs/
├── docker/
├── kubernetes/
├── openshift/
├── ecs/
├── terraform/
└── cicd/


Each folder → README with:

What you built

Issues faced

How you fixed them

💥 This alone separates you from 80% candidates.

🔥 Next (Highly Recommended)

I can next:
1️⃣ Give you real OpenShift + ECS interview questions (with answers)
2️⃣ Design a single end-to-end capstone project
3️⃣ Rewrite your resume bullets for DevOps roles

Say the number and we’ll keep pushing 🚀
